To Understand the cycles of the composter, I started monitoring the temperature and humidity of my composter, using NodeMCU and DHT11.

# Sensor Informations
ID = 1 > DHT11 used at Arduino first file version and stayed at Box1 with avatar DHT11Caixa1;
ID = 2 > DHT22 is using an Arduino second file version and its at Box 2 with avatar DHT22Caixa2;
ID = 3 > DHT22 is using an Arduino second file version and its at Box 2 with avatar DHT22Caixa2;
ID = 4 > DHT22 is using an Arduino second file version and its at Box 2 with avatar DHT22Caixa2
